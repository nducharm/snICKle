# snICKle
> Working title.

I like to mess around with guitar tones. But, as an only-recently-reformed grad student, I don't have the funds to build up a library of different guitars, pedals, amps and amp modelers. Lucky for me, I know some math! So I decided to code up my own amp modeling software, complete with its own (admittedly small) library of DSP effects. This is that.

For now, what you can do with the snICKle is:
1. record a snippet of sound;
2. apply some standard effects to your recording (the kind of effects you would be likely to find on a basic combo amp);
3. play back the filtered sound to see what it sounds like.

I'll gradually be adding more effects as I figure out how to model them digitally, and I have some more ambitious ideas for the project that may materialize after I take some time to work on other projects.
