# snICKle
> Working title.

I like to mess around with guitar tones. But, as an only-recently-reformed grad student, I don't have the funds to build up a library of different guitars, pedals, amps and amp modelers. Lucky for me, digital signal processing is the exact type of thing that the mathematics I spent the last two years learning is good for in the real world! So I decided to make my own amp modeling software. This is that.

For now, what you can do with the snICKle is:
1. record a snippet of sound;
2. apply some standard effects to your recording (the kind of effects you would be likely to find on a starter combo amp);
3. play back the filtered sound to see what it sounds like.

I'll gradually be adding more effects as I figure out how to model them digitally, and I have some more ambitious ideas for the project that may materialize a ways down the line.
